Question:
  q1:
    title: What shall I do tonight with my girlfriend?
    User: fabien
    body:  |
      We shall meet in front of the __Dunkin'Donuts__ before dinner, 
      and I haven't the slightest idea of what I can do with her. 
      She's not interested in _programming_, _space opera movies_ nor _insects_.
      She's kinda cute, so I __really__ need to find something 
      that will keep her to my side for another evening.

  q2:
    title: What can I offer to my step mother?
    User: anonymous
    body:  |
      My stepmother has everything a stepmother is usually offered
      (watch, vacuum cleaner, earrings, [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) account). 
      Her birthday comes next week, I am broke, and I know that 
      if I don't offer her something *sweet*, my girlfriend 
      won't look at me in the eyes for another month.

  q3:
    title: How can I generate traffic to my blog?
    User: francois
    body:  |
      I have a very swell blog that talks 
      about my class and mates and pets and favorite movies.

      You can try to read her poetry. Chicks love that kind of things.

  a2_q1:
    Question: q1
    User:     fabien
    body:        |
      Don't bring her to a donuts shop. Ever. Girls don't like to be
      seen eating with their fingers - although it's nice. 

  a3_q2:
    Question: q2
    User:     fabien
    body:        |
      The answer is in the question, buy her a step, so she can 
      get some exercise and be grateful for the weight she will
      lose.

  a4_q3:
    Question: q3
    User:     fabien
    body:        |
      Build it with symfony - and people will love it.
